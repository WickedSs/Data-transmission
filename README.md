# Data-transmission-
Tranferring data between two hardwares 

# Idea 
Reliable data tranferring ( RDT ), which is this project that i worked on. 
It shows you an implementaion of how data is being transferred between two computers, using 2 programmable arduino nano linked togther, which one of the plays the role of a sender and the other one is a receiver.
